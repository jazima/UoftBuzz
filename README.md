# UofTBuzz üêù

## About the Project
Hello U of T folks! üåü UofTBuzz is a digital bulletin board designed especially for our community. It's a space where both event organizers and students can post and discover upcoming events with ease. Event hosts can share all the essential details, making it simpler for attendees to find and join. Say goodbye to the old-school method of physically pinning flyers and enjoy a centralized platform for all our campus happenings.
